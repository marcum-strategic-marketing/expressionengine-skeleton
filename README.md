# expressionengine-skeleton-bootstrap
An ExpressionEngine Skeleton Website And Template Repository

This is meant to be a starting point for a new ExpressionEngine website build project.
Ideally this repository will be kept up to date with the latest needs from a starting point site.
Anew project would be started from this template repository and modified as needed.

Upon cloning config/config.env.php will need modified with the agreed upon URLs including the local dev URL.
config/config.master.php may also need modified depending on need.
config/config.local.php is included as a template for local development but should not be tracked or comitted.

Includes NPM package for Bootstrap and preconfiguration for using Bootstrap Front-end.
