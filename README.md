# expressionengine-skeleton
An ExpressionEngine Skeleton Website And Template Repository

This is meant to be a starting point for a new ExpressionEngine website build project.
Ideally this repository will be kept up to date with the latest needs from a starting point site.
A new project would be started from this template repository and modified as needed from there.

Upon cloning config/config.env.php will need modified with the agreed upon URLs including the local dev URL.
config/config.master.php may also need modified depending on need.
config/config.local.php is included as a template for local development but should not be tracked or comitted.

Included Structure And WYGWAM Add-Ons and added default additional menu items for Structure and Template Manager in the EE backend.

This Repo also includes branches if you wish to start with a front-end framework.
Bootstrap branch includes an NPM package for Bootstrap and preconfiguration for using Bootstrap Front-end.
Foundation branch includes an NPM package for Foundation and preconfiguration for using Foundation Front-end.

**Don't Forget To License The Add-Ons For Production**
